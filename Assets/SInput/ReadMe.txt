
Hi there,

  Thanks for checking Sinput, I am still working on this
  system but hopefully it does everything you need it to.

  I do need to spend time working on my own games and stuff
  but if you have any suggestions or Qs message me @S0phieH,
  I'll help you out if I can <3

      Love,
	    Sophie. <3

 This system is 100% free in all circumstances,
 but if you want to leave a tip on itch or support me on patreon that
 would be awesome and very helpful to me!

For now, documentation can be found at:

I will likely include documentation with the Sinput package once the system is a
little more stable and I'm not changing so much every version :)
